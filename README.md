# react-blog
This is my first react application which uses https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com API to get fake data.

## How to use
    git clone https://github.com/behnambm/react-blog.git
    cd react-blog
    npm install
    npm run start   # runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.



Use `npm build` to build the app for production.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
